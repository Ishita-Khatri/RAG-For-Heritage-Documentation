West Belfry Tower,"The material used for the West Belfry Tower is Morley stone (Meuse), an oolitic limestone. The tower was built around the turn of the century. The current state of the tower was deteriorating due to its exposed location without shelter from the elements, leading to fragility and stone pieces falling off. Restoration efforts began in 1947, supported by a budget from the Grand Council of Vaud. The restoration project aimed to replace the molasse with Morley stone, known for being more resistant and less expensive. The restoration work targeted the deteriorated facing of the tower, focusing on the upper parts first, then the belfry galleries, and finally the lower part. The restoration involved cleaning the tower using a comb and applying Morley stone to renew the facing. The restoration efforts aimed to address structural deterioration and superficial alterations caused by weathering, such as patchy deterioration, patinas, black crusts, and crumbling. The restoration work included preserving ancient surfaces by allowing slabs to deteriorate slowly, ensuring the static safety of the building and passers-by."
South,"The material used for the South facade of Lausanne Cathedral is gray Molasse de Lausanne, which has been exposed for more than 700 years. The current age of the South facade dates back to the 13th century. The facade is mainly affected by various forms of deterioration, including patchy deterioration, granular disintegration, and crusting. Restoration efforts have targeted different types of deterioration over time, with specific treatments applied based on the nature and severity of the deterioration. Various materials and techniques have been used for restoration, such as cleaning of dust and friable surface materials, treatment of stained areas and crusts, and addressing persistent biological colonization.

North Staircase Tower,"The North Staircase Tower of Lausanne Cathedral was built using gray molasse, a local sandstone. The tower was likely constructed around 1225 and was completed before the fire of 1235. The tower shows signs of reddening on the north gable and roof, indicating its age and the impact of the fire. The material used for the tower is soft Lausanne sandstone. The tower was affected by the fire of 1235, with the roof structure burning, but the cathedral itself was less affected due to its vaults. The fire damage is visible above the vaults in the form of reddening and bursting of the sandstone facings. The restoration efforts on the North Staircase Tower included making copies of the original column statues to protect the most damaged pieces. Plaster casts were made in the 1920s, and six copies were installed in the portal between 1925 and 1927. The medieval statues were moved to the southern transept. The restoration also involved attempts to recreate the polychromy of the statues. Additionally, modern stained glass windows were gradually installed from the second competition in 1928, overseen by an ad hoc commission and the Restoration Committee."
